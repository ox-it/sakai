Sakai's Support for IMS Standards
---------------------------------

This folder holds the Sakai code for IMS Learning Tools Interoperability and other standards.
This area has many different contributors.  

There are several internal documents that you might find useful ranging from test plans to developer/configuration
documentation.  These documents are stored here in github:

* [Sakai LTI Documentation](https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/tree/master/basiclti/basiclti-docs/resources/docs)

Sakai has a unit test that we keep up-to-date with the latest LTI specifications.  The 
test harness functions as both Consumer and Provider and exercises both standard services 
and Sakai's particular extensions.  I make this tool available online at
