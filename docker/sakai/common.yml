# This sets up WebLearn(Sakai) for a developer, so it runs with the debugger enabled and shouldn't allocate as much
# resources as we use in production.
# It exposes the webserver publicly, but all the developer services (mysql, debug port, jmx) just on localhost.

  # If you want to test the production image swap the previous line with this one.

  # Not too sure about this as there seem to be IO errors with using volumes like
  # this, eg corrupt files and missing files.
