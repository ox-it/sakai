<h2>Browsing / Searching for a Module</h2>

<p>There are four ways to find modules. You may: <strong>Search Modules</strong>, <strong>Browse by Department</strong>, 
<strong>Browse by Calendar</strong> (date), or <strong>Search by Vitae RDF Domains and Subdomain</strong>.</p>


<h3>Search Modules</h3>

<p>It is possible to search for a module by title, department, skill category and so on.  
To start, click <strong>Search Modules</strong> on 
the <strong>Home</strong> page or in the navigation 
menu at the top of the page.  The resultant page will display a search box.</p>
<p>To search:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter the required search term and click <strong>Search</strong>, if you do not enter a term, 
then all upcoming courses are listed. You can refine your search later. </li>
  <li>The search results page lists 10 courses at a time. To find out more about a course, click on the 'More details' button. </li>
  <li>To refine the results, click on a search facet in the right-hand side column. you can filter on: Department, Skills Category, Research Method (if appropriate), Delivery Method and RDF Domain and Sub-domain. </li>
  <li>Old courses can also be browsed which will give an indication of what courses may be run again in the future.</li>
 <li>It is possible to widen filtered search results by removing one or more of the selected facets. To do this, click on the desired facet under 'Current Selection' in the area above the list of search results.
</ol>

<h3>Browse by Department</h3>

<p>Click <strong>Browse by Department</strong> on the <strong>Home</strong> page or in the navigation 
menu at the top of the page.  The resultant page will display a list of training providers.

  <li>MPLS and Social Sciences courses are colour coded; this is not the case for other training providers. 
Modules in green are available for sign up, modules in black are not available for sign up and those 
in red are already full. (Modules in green also contain the number of days left before the 
course is closed for signup.)</li>
  <li>Click on an individual Module in the navigation tree to display the corresponding Module information on the right.</li>
  <li>Click the signup button or hyperlink if you wish to sign up for the course.  </li>

head of the table of modules and then click on the <strong>Filter</strong> button.</li>
