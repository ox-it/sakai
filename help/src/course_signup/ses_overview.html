<h2>Researcher Training tool: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>
<p>The Researcher Training tool (which was formerly known as the Student Enrolment System (or SES)) is a
discovery and  enrolment tool offering an extensive range of courses and modules from <strong>all</strong> of the 
university's graduate training providers. These are:</p>


<ul>
<li>MPLS Division</li>
<li>Social Sciences Division</li>
<li>Humanities Division</li>
<li>Medical Sciences Division</li>
<li>IT Learning Program (IT Services)</li>
<li>Language Centre</li>
<li>Careers Service</li>
<li>Bodleian Libraries</li>
<li>University Skills Group (online courses only)</li>
<li>Continuing Education</li>
<li>Safety Office</li>
</ul>

<p>The tool is available to all staff and students of the university, however, the primary focus 
is on graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.</p>

<p>For courses offered by MPLS and Social Sciences this tool is used to manage the sign up 
work-flow. For all other training providers, the tool acts as a launch-pad into a separate 
registration system. At the bottom of each course information page there is either 
a 'Sign up' button or a link to the relevant external system.</p>

<p>In MPLS the tool is also used for module sign-up  and includes academic courses, research, teaching, 
transferable skills and career development training. These courses make up the 
Graduate Academic Programme from which you and your supervisor are able to tailor a 
customised training programme to suit your individual needs and interests. </p>

<p>The departments that form the MPLS academic division are: Chemistry, Computing Laboratory, 
Earth Sciences, Engineering, Materials, Mathematics, Physics, Plant Sciences, Statistics, Zoology, 
the Oxford eResearch Centre, and the Doctoral Training Centres in the Life Sciences Interface, 
Systems Biology, and Systems Approaches to Biomedical Science. </p>

<p>Social Sciences (SSD)  also use the tool for module sign-up and is available to all graduate students 
to register for modules and courses that are shared across the social science 
departments and for activities coordinated by the SSD divisional office.</p>

<p>The departments that form the SSD academic division are: Anthropology, Archaeology, Economics, 
Education, Interdisciplinary Area Studies, International Development, Law, Oxford Internet 
Institute, Politics and International Relations, Said Business School, Social Policy and 
Intervention, Sociology, School of Geography and the Environment. </p>
