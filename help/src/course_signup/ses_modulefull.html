<h2>What to do if a Module is Full</h2>
<p>If you find a module you would like to enrol for but it is full you have the option of being added to a waiting list. In the module you are trying to enrol for, click on the <strong><code>Join Waiting List</code></strong> button which will prompt you to add your supervisor's email and reasons for attending the course. If a place becomes available on the course you will receive an email confirmation offering you a place from the <strong><code>Module Administrator</code></strong>. </p>
