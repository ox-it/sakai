<h2>Checking My Status on a Module</h2>
<p>Click on <strong><code>My Modules</code></strong> at the top of the <strong><code>Module Signup</code></strong> page.
<p>A list of Modules you have applied for is displayed including your status: either <strong><code>PENDING</code></strong>,
 <strong><code>ACCEPTED</code></strong>, <strong><code>APPROVED</code></strong>, <strong><code>WITHDRAWN</code></strong>  or <strong><code>REJECTED</code></strong>. You can use the filters on the header to sort your modules by module, by supervisor, and by status. </p>

<ol><li>
  <p><strong><code>PENDING</code></strong> This status indicates you have applied for the course and are waiting for confirmation from the Module Administrator. </p>
</li>
 <li>
   <p><strong><code>ACCEPTED</code></strong> Once a Module Administrator has confirmed your signup the status for this module will change to accepted. </p>
 </li>
<li>
  <p><strong><code>APPROVED</code></strong> When a Module Administrator has accepted you onto the module, an email is sent to your supervisor. Once he or she has approved your attendance on the course, the status will change to approved. </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p><strong><code>WITHDRAWN</code></strong> In this screen you have the option to withdraw from a course. By clicking the withdraw link on the far right of the module you will be withdrawn from the course. </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p><strong><code>REJECTED</code></strong> If your supervisor does not think you should attend the course they will reject your request. You will be sent an email indicating this but your status will also change to rejected by the module. A Module Administrator may also wish to reject you before the supervisor approval stage and again you will be notified by email. </p>
</li></ol>
