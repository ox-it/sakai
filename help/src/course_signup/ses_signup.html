  <p>Select the module parts you wish attend by clicking the radio button next to the option which suits you &#45; this will be made clear in the description (for example, you may be required to sign up 
for both a Laboratory and Lecture series).  In many cases there will be only one module part to select. Click the grey <strong>Signup</strong> button at the bottom of the course description. </p>
</li>

an email address recognised by the University.  </p></li>
