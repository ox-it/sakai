<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
You can use the <a href="http://www.vitae.ac.uk/CMS/files/upload/Vitae-Researcher-Development-Framework.pdf" target="_blank">Researcher Development Framework</a> (RDF) (see the interactive wheel diagram below) to reflect on the multifaceted nature of research and to help you think strategically about your developmental aims, needs and aspirations as a researcher and plan your steps towards them by assessing and developing the skills and attributes you will need. The RDF brings together key skills, knowledge, behaviours and attitudes relevant to researchers. The RDF, created by <a href="http://www.vitae.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Vitae</a> from interviews with researchers, is used by universities across the UK to guide researcher learning and development.
</p>
<h2>The Framework</h2>
<p>
The RDF has four Domains, each of which incorporates three Subdomains. Each Subdomain is broken down further into Descriptors. Hover over a Subdomain on the wheel to view its associated Descriptors. These are the key skills, knowledge, behaviours and attitudes that researchers learn, develop or improve as they progress in their work.
</p>
<h2>How to use the RDF</h2>
<p>
As a researcher, you can use the RDF Domains, Subdomains and Descriptors strategically to help you plan your learning and development, according to your career stage, plans and aspirations. For example, if you would like to improve your knowledge of research governance and organisation (Domain C) by learning more about research management (Subdomain C2), then you might ask yourself, `At this stage of my research career, is my biggest priority strategy, planning projects or managing risk (all Descriptors tied to Subdomain C2), and how can I develop the knowledge and skills I need to meet this priority I've identified?`
</p>
<p>
At Oxford, our researcher development training is tagged with RDF Domains and Subdomains to make it clear how the training relates to specific parts of the RDF. It is important to recognise that the RDF is holistic. Over time, you should aim to develop across all four Domains and to integrate your experience, development and learning. As well as attending courses, consider how you might learn in other ways - for example reflecting on what you might learn from observing and discussing with others; from your reading; or through experience. You may find <a href="http://www.vitae.ac.uk/CMS/files/upload/Vitae-Excel-RDF-Planner-Prototype-2010.xls" target="_blank">Vitae's interactive downloadable RDF Planner</a> a useful tool for assisting this process.
