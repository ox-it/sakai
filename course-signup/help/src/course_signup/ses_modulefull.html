<h2>What to do if a Course is Full</h2>
<p>This only applies to courses that can be booked in this tool - this means courses offered by Social Sciences and MPLS.</p>
<p>If you find a course you would like to enrol for but it is full you have the option of being added to a waiting list. In the course you are trying to enrol for, click on the <strong>Join Waiting List</strong> button which will prompt you to add your supervisor's email and reasons for attending the course. If a place becomes available on the course you will receive an email confirmation offering you a place from the <strong>Course Administrator</strong>. </p>
